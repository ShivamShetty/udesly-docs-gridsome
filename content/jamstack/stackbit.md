# What is Stackbit?

[Stackbit](https://www.stackbit.com/) is the first open, complete platform for the Jamstack. It‚Äôs the easiest way to get started with the best tools for the modern web. Whether you're a designer switching from Webflow or other design-first platforms, a developer getting started on the Jamstack, or a marketer looking to leverage modern web tech, Stackbit enables you to easily build and edit Jamstack sites using a [simple, intuitive interface](https://www.stackbit.com/blog/announcing-stackbit-studio/).

## How Does it Work?

Unlocking the power of Jamstack sites for designers, developers, marketers and agencies, you get fast, SEO-friendly, powerful and secure websites without having to constantly bug a developer for updates. Stackbit provides a layer of usability that enables editing sites on the Jamstack, without writing a single line of code. Any change that you make in the Stackbit Studio automatically updates your CMS, and your code is kept in your own GitHub repository. Stackbit handles all the details for you behind the scenes so your site can be more powerful, and you can be free to focus on your work. The Studio offers an intuitive interface with live previews, inline editing, collaboration tools, A/B testing and more.
